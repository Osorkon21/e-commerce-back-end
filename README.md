# E-Commerce Back End

  ## Description

  The back end of this e-commerce site is now operational! API calls return database information on Products, Categories, and Tags.

  ## Installation

  Node.js and mySQL are required. Clone this repo and navigate to the root folder on your console. Enter ```npm i``` to install the necessary node packages, then enter ```mysql -u root -p``` to start the mySQL shell and enter your mySQL password. Then, enter ```source ./db/schema.sql```. Type ```quit``` to exit the mySQL shell. Then enter ```npm run seed```. This creates and seeds your E-Commerce database. 

  ## Usage

  As this application is not deployed, it can only be used locally. Navigate to the root folder of the project on your console. Enter ```node server.js``` to start the server. Sample requests using Insomnia are available in the walkthrough video.
